    <h3>Fighting World Hunger: Strategies and Solutions📏</h3>
    <p>Together, we can build a world where everyone has access to the food and nutrition they need to thrive.</p>
    <h2>About My Topic🔔</h2>
    <p>World hunger is a pervasive and complex problem that affects millions of people around the globe. Despite
      significant progress in reducing hunger and malnutrition in recent decades, around 9.2% of the world's population
      still suffer from chronic undernourishment, with the highest rates found in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
      Hunger is not just a matter of food availability, but also of access to food, income, education, and healthcare,
      among other factors. Addressing the root causes of hunger and promoting sustainable and equitable food systems is
      essential for achieving food security, health, and human dignity for all.</p>
    <h2>What is World Hunger?😵</h2>
    <p>World hunger refers to the persistent and widespread lack of sufficient food and nutrition necessary for a
      healthy
      and active life among people around the world. It is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects millions of
      individuals and communities, and is often caused by poverty, inequality, conflict, and climate change, among other
      factors.</p>

    <h3>Data about World Hunger🤯</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Approximately 690 million people around the world are undernourished, meaning they do not have access to
        enough
        food to meet their daily energy requirements.</li>
      <li>Hunger and malnutrition contribute to the deaths of around 3.1 million children under the age of five each
        year.
      </li>
      <li>Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are the regions with the highest prevalence of undernourishment.</li>
      <li>COVID-19 has worsened global hunger, with an estimated 161 million more people experiencing hunger in 2020 due
        to the pandemic's economic impacts.</li>
      <li>The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved
        nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.</li>

        <p>Fighting world hunger requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach that involves governments, NGOs,
          and
          individuals. Some of the effective strategies to combat hunger include improving agricultural productivity,
          increasing access to education and healthcare, promoting gender equality, investing in social protection
          programs,
          and providing emergency food aid and nutrition support to those in need. Additionally, reducing food waste,
          promoting sustainable farming practices, and addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality are also
          crucial
          in the fight against world hunger.</p>

              <p>The United Nations has warned that more than 10 million children in Yemen are at risk of starvation due
                to
                the
                ongoing conflict and economic crisis in the country. The situation has been worsened by a lack of

              <h3>South Sudan Facing Worsening Hunger Crisis, Warns UN</h3>
              <p>The United Nations has warned that South Sudan is facing its worst hunger crisis in a decade, with
                around
                60%
                of
                the population, or 7.2 million people, experiencing severe food insecurity. The situation has been
                exacerbated
                by conflict, displacement, and economic challenges, as well as climate-related shocks like floods and
                droughts.
                The UN is calling for urgent action to address the crisis, including increasing funding for humanitarian
                aid
                and supporting local food production.</p>
